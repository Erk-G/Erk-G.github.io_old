                An interesting challenge. 
                There were a lot of places I didn't imagine having a tough time with like the first rival fight, but there was also some funny cheese. 
                Using a lvl 11 gastly for awhile for its curse and that lvl 40 tentacruel right before the steel gym were some of the highlights.
