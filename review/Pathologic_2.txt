                I’ll come back to this when the Bachelor comes out because it doesn’t feel right to write this without fully remembering my playthrough. 
                I will say I had some brutal failures in this game though. 
                I remember my one goal was to keep Artemy’s childhood friends alive and I couldn’t do that and that realization was depressing. 
                It’s also been awhile since I felt tense at the thought of going into combat especially when one quest forces it on you. 
                I like this game.
