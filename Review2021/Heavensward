Started out good, but man what a way to ruin the cool ending to ARR.
<span class="spoiler"> Nanamo isn't dead, you actually never needed to be on the run because the Crystal Braves were rejected any power from even Ul'Dah. 
The consequences of this ended up being pretty small in the long run.</span>
For all the memes about "The Award Winning Heavensward" it's fine.
Like there reaally isn't anything special about Heavensward.
Sure I would rate it as an above average FF story, but considering you have FF 1-4 and 8 thats not exactly high praise.
The patch content though is another story, really good.
Unlike ARR, HW post patch is lore rich and entertaining to read.
Music is still great.
I am not going to talk much about the gameplay until Shadowbringers because there honestly is not much to talk about.
