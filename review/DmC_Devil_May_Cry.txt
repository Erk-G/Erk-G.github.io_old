                As it turns out, I was right when suspecting other people’s rankings of DMC games. 
                Obviously this game is better than DMC2. 
                DmC’s story isn’t going to impress people, more like roll their eyes but man is DMC2s story way worse because it’s just boring. 
                Gameplay is not even a question. 
                I couldn’t even imagine how garbage DmC had to be to be worse, and the circumstances for people to release a shittier game than DMC2. 
                So of course it's better. 
                I also think it’s better than DMC1 because it is a modern game that wasn’t the first in its kind. 
                Like the “Seinfeld isn’t funny” trope, this game is better because the genre had evolved to be funner so it isn’t that hard to believe a game released in 2013 is better than the one that both started it and released in 2001. 
                A newer game can be worse than a much older game, but usually, especially with sequels/reboots, that isn’t expected. 
                On the whole this is on par with DMC4 because both games are fun but have a decent amount of issues from putting one over the other.

            <h3>
                Things I don’t like about DmC
            </h3>
            <h4>
                DmC is poorly balanced
            </h4>
            <p>
                I heard this is pretty easy even on Nephilim, which is the hardest difficulty from the start. 
                To solve this in definitive they added a hardcore mode to rebalance it, but they rebalance it in more of the mindset that you have all the weapons and a lot of skills. 
                Meaning the first mission you’ll get a D rank in style, and even after that you probably won’t get above a C until much later. 
                The second angel weapon I felt was really necessary to fight some enemies and that is the last weapon you get about halfway through the game. 
                Devil trigger charges up too slow and burns too fast, so it’ll only be used for health regen or one combo on enemies that block your non-DT attacks.

            <h3>
                Cutscenes
            </h3>
            <p>
                I’m not going to talk about the story because it’s not very good. 
                If DMC1 has one advantage that barely puts it over DmC and that is its cheesiness. 
                Cutscenes though ruin the replayability a little bit cause unlike most DMC games they are not limited to the beginning and end of a mission. 
                You can skip them but the worst of them are the walking cutscenes. 
                Cutscenes where you are just walking and there may or may not be dialogue happening, but you can’t skip them cause it is technically gameplay.
            </p>
                

                <h3>Things from DmC I want to be in future DMC games</h3>

                <h4>
                How they do B combos
                </h4>
                <p>
                In a DMC game, a B combo is when you pause in the middle then continue it making the character do different moves. 
                There’s not really any indicators, but I never saw that as a problem. 
                In DmC if you pause when you want to do a B combo then your weapon gets a flash, a “Shing” sound effect and your controller rumbles a little indicating when you can pull it off. 
                I like it. It feels nice.
                </p>
                <h4>
                Better platforming
                </h4>
                <p>
                Like any DMC fan I would actually prefer it if they just didn’t include platforming, but if they did just include the fixes this game gives like the airdash.
                </p>

                <h4>
                Dante Grapple
                </h4>
                <p>
                I like the grapple. Only problem I see is it would take away half of Nero’s uniqueness.
                </p>

                <h4>
                Rank Scream
                </h4>
                <p>
                I liked when the guy screams out the style rank name mid battle. You know you’re doing well when the guy screams “SAVAGE.” 
                I could see how people wouldn’t like it though because I liked...
                </p>

                <h4>
                Stinger without Dante yelling
                </h4>
                <p>
                Yeah I said it. It was annoying.
                </p>
                <h4></h4>
                L2 R2 for equipping weapons
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is an idea I’m conflicted about cause it felt awkward holding down the button the whole time. 
                Maybe just pushing the button once to equip and pushing it again to re-equip Rebellion would work.
                 Like you push R2 to equip the Axe you could push it again to equip Rebellion or you could equip the scythe and push L2 again to equip Rebellion.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Anyway, DmC is good but is pretty rough around the edges. Nothing in DMC 1-4 beats the TV fight or the gimmicky disco colosseum in terms of creative missions.
