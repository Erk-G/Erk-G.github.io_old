                I had fun with Sonic 2 until Oil Ocean, which I didn’t like in Sonic Mania so that was not a surprise. 
                Then I got to Metropolis Zone and man this game gets brutal. 
                Why does the game get this hard? 
                Actually it might be wrong to call it hard and more fitting to call it unfair. 
                The zone acts are long, the platforming is dangerous, the screw elevators have enemies shooting projectiles at you, checkpoints are sparse and so are rings. 
                This zone also has 3 acts! Sky Chase zone is a short break before the game goes back to being brutal with there even being a leap of faith in Wing Fortress. 
                I’m guessing the thing that speeds sonic up isn’t supposed to just toss Sonic off the ledge and is supposed to keep him grounded and running in that part, but on the switch Sega Ages port it just kills you. 
                So this game is fun up until the point where it just hates you.
