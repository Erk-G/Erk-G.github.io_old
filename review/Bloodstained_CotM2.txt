                I had 2 separate opinions on this game, one was my first two playthroughs and the other at the end of my playthroughs. 
                My first was ‘Jesus this game is way harder than the first and probably too much so.” 
                My second is “This was actually pretty fun, but feels way too long.” 
                If there is one thing I could add to this game that would bump it up to a ‘recommend for everyone’ rating, it would be adding an option for infinite lives but without the other stuff ‘casual mode’ adds (maybe keep the increased checkpoints though because the platforming before the mummy boss is draining). 
                I’m fine with the increased damage and the knockback, but I would like to not start over from the very beginning if I die too much. 
                This is all for the first time experience though, since like with most games if you play it enough you learn and deal with the challenges. 
                Except that bat boss that makes a return from CotM1, she goes so fast that I hate that fight even though you have infinite lives for it as long as you collect all the money bags from the 5-8 minute trek back to her fight. 
                This game has one extra playthrough than the first but the levels feel too samey and the final chapter wants you to do multiple runs of one level if you want to get all the upgrades. 
                Best characterization in a Bloodstained game though.
