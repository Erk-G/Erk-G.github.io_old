DMC5 is the best DMC in the series, and if a special edition releases and it gets as much content as DMC4SE then it won’t even be an argument. Style switching on the fly, check, able to use all different weapons, check, all of the different weapons are fun to use, check, kept the dude screaming style names, check, zoom in when the fight is over, I mean I didn’t really want it but it’s there. Gave Nero some sweet abilities on his “style” button instead of the lame but strong grapple thing (SPOILER And they keep the ability to use his old arm with an actual devil trigger). A DMC game finally has a song I like in it, both versions of “Devil Trigger.” I like the effort they put into the story because no other DMC game really cared at all. There were only a few middling things in this game. 
Why can’t I just switch between Nero’s arms? You can make it take awhile, but needing to break them is lame.
V isn’t that cool to play as but you don’t play as him much.
Dr. Faust feels like wasted potential at least for the playthrough you get it. You need red orbs for upgrades and the hat either wastes them or has huge risks to using it, but it looks so cool.
I hope if DMC5SE gets made has online bloody palace multiplayer since they added that into DMC3SE switch edition, and maybe add in the characters that were added in DMC4SE.
