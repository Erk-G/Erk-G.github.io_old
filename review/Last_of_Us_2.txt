                Speaking as someone who liked the first game, but who pretty much stopped liking Joel after a certain point 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU1 I was really surprised I was the only one who thought he was kind of a monster after the hospital. 
                I was more inclined to think that way because I left no one alive in that section of the game, but I doubt everyone was sneaking through the whole section.), 
                I thought the reason people were mad was dumb 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU2 Like seriously we had a whole affair/one night stand on screen with Abby and that one guy and no one used that against her from what I saw). 
                I liked the game for the most part. I thought it was too long and there was one story thing that made me pretty upset (SPOILER When Ellie goes to California because 1. 
                Even in the best case scenario which does happen, she still ruins her life with Dina and 2. I had to play more game), but thatâ€™s about it.
