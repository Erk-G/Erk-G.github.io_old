Man remember what I said about NMH2. Fucking throw that in the trash because No More Heroes 3 is awesome.
Combat isn't like swinging a wet noodle.
Wrestling has a purpose.
Get cool powers. (For some reason all at once).
Bosses are entertaining, but enemies are the actual difficult part of this game.
Rest in piece the stages, a shame you died in order to make combat consistantly 60fps.
No stages isn't a knock off this game at all because it just plays leagues better than the last two games.
Like this is going from DMC1 to DMC3 its that good. Too bad there's not going to be a 4th game.
Story is very entertaining, music is super different from a typical NMH game.
This game is so good.

Spoilers:
The podcast bits were great and an amazing lead up to the punnchline that is Travis asking Miike to direct a NMH movie.
I would watch that movie.
Returning cast is great, and this game actually made me interested in buying the silver case games.
Such a dick move how this game clearly teases you with more story, but it is expected at this point.
Jeannes voice, A+.
The openings and endings to each episode are great.
