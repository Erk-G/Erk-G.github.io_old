            <p>
                I’m just going to do a Q&A for this game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do I like it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
                What do you think about the changes to the story?
            </p>
            <p>
                Not very positive about them. Fan theories make them more interesting than they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you think the writers can pull off what they’re going for?
            </p>
            <p>
                I played Kingdom Hearts. I’m a fan of Kingdom Hearts. I have no faith they can pull it off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Major complaints?
            </p>
            <p>
                The game could cut out 10 hours overall and it would be better for it.
