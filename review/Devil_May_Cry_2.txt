                Wow this game sucks. 
                I honestly can’t recall anything from the story since the game delivers plot so unequally. 
                There are cutscenes in this game that are like 20 seconds, it's hilarious. 
                Dante’s boring but I thought he was pretty boring in the first game so whatever. 
                As for gameplay, if you know anything about this game you would expect me to say you can just shoot your guns and win the game. 
                While that’s true, I’ll give the game credit in that it's not optimal. 
                You spam stinger at flinch less enemies/bosses to win the game. 
                Enemies are still pretty “shoot to win”, but sword is a little bit faster.
                Also, the sword doesn’t have any impact, and the other weapons are swords that have the same moveset. 
                You can ignore most enemy encounters, which is funny and also a little frustrating because I played this game while watching videos and sometimes I would mindlessly fight only to remember I can just leave. I got lost a lot in this game, so I had to look up a speedrun sometimes. The first phase of the final boss is the worst because I never collected any blue orbs and it combines every boss, which amounts to every boss shooting its high damage projectiles at you while having a ton of health.

                That’s it really. I heard the one upside is this game has good music, but I don’t really like DMC music so there is no upside for me. Just a bad boring game. 
                It did introduce the gold orb system into DMC, so I guess DMC2 was worth it.
