                I like Zero 3. It tried to make the elf system more fair when it comes to rank by letting you upgrade them to equip them and not use them. 
                It kinda doesn’t work because if you need to do this you probably aren’t that good at the game. 
                It also introduced Omega who is pretty neat as a boss, but it also annoyed me with the story stuff about him. 
                SPOILERS <span class="spoiler">I don’t understand the dilemma Zero has about Omega being his real body. 
                If the wording was phrased as “That is the real Zero.” that would have been cooler because then current Zero killing it would mean something along the lines of, Zero is more like a title or a concept than a name. 
                I feel like it would be cooler if it was worded like that.</span>
