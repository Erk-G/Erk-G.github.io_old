This game is in the top 3 ace attorney games. 
It managed to be interesting pretty much the whole way through with only 1 or 2 non-gimmick moments thay made me go "Why?"
The last game made me question why people wanted this director (writer?) back, and this one showed me why. 
(Though this is a great game to send off on, and AA6 is also in my top 3)
I only have 2 complaints.
</p>
<p>
1. The gimmicks of GAA pretty much don't add anything to the story.
</p>

Turning over the judges opinion is fun and you do get a lot of story from talking to the judges, but in this game especially the way these start are very contrived.
There wasn't a single time where I thought "fair enough" when the judges all voted guilty because either I had evidence that would prove otherwise or one of the judges statements have no reason to lean one way or the other (it should've been innocent if anything).

Speaking of contrived, damn, those Herlock deductions. So flashy, so pointless.
In the first game I stopped reading the first half because I knew I had to read it again anyways.
In this game I just stopped reading them. It's pretty easy to know what's happening through context clues.
You can also game over from these? That's dumb.
All in all if I saw "The game is afoot!" written on a page with Herlock on the side I just stopped reading until I solved it.

2. This gamee is just the rest of the first game, which means you have to play the first game.
</p>

I wouldn't say GAA1 is bad, but it is unsatisfying for how long it is.

This game's animation are like surprisingly good. I don't remember AA6 being anywhere near this good.
The new music is great, and man the "things are getting serious" song is probably the best one.
This first case is the best one in the series, but to be fair it's more like the 6th case because (see point 2).
<span class="spoiler"> Really werid that it turns out  half or more than half the cast were criminals. </span>
