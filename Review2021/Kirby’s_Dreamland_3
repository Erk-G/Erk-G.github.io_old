Oddly enough, it feels like this is the fasted Kirby has ever moved.
Momentum in this game is a little busted.
Coo umbrella is still amazing. I thought they were both nerfed but coo can air dash and umbrella still has good i-frames.
The 100% experience is tied for the worst for main story collection.
Each stage has an objective that if you meet you get a heart star.
None of them are very straight forward save for the mid-stage minigames.
A lot of them make the stage harder, and the very last one requires something from another stage, which might be a hint but I was giving the game props up until then for not doing that.
Game is very cute though, and most of the music is great. 
Final boss is an easier Dreamland 2 final boss.
The last 3% of the game comes from a boss rush, a minigame rush and getting ten points at the end of stage minigame.
Started the boss rush because "All of the bosses except for Adeline were cakewalks."
*3 bosses in* "When do I heal?"
Wiki-"No healing"
Brutal.
So yea I saved scummed the last 3% because I didn't want to waste my time.
Last two are ones I can't save scum, Robobot and Star Allies.
