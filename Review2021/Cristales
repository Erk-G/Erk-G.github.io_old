Wow, I did not like this game.
Music is very generic in a bad way.
Story is just kinda all over the place.
Wish there was a better explanation for crits and guards. I figured it out, but that was annoying.
Game commits the sin of removing characters from party but not leveling them with you.
It feels like there are sound effects missing.
The early game feels really dangerous because tents cost a fuck ton.
For no reason either, once you get a healing spell you don't need to buy a tent.
Even in the mid game tents cost way too much to consider buying.
Why does Ky exploding hurt everyone? That makes him so bad.
I can feel this game having a million ideas, and story beats but somehow not having enough time in its 30 hours to implement any of it.
First time in awhile I thought "So close, but so very far"

<span class="spoiler"> Why does a quest not relating in any way to creaating a board for a government, and only serves as foreshadowing to something in the future, a requiriement for that option?</span>
