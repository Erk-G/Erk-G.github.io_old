I was obsessed wth this game.
Beat the game with every character.
Then played it some more with rainbow mode.
I played the switch version so loading up the in game guide took forever.
Also it was never helpful so I just pulled up the website wiki.
Seriously these games just need to have good explanations on what items do.
I don't wanna pull up a website.
Game really scratched an itch for bullet hell that ZeroRanger gave me.
Pro tip: Clone is not the best pick for first item in rainbow mode.
I was pretty likely to die the next floor because I did not have a good gun or something.
