When this game was announced I was pretty down on it. Then it came out and I saw some gameplay and was excited to play.
After playing it, I was pretty right to be down on it.
There's something about the unique characters that make the microgames themselves un-memorable.
Not an easy pick up and play with friends because every character plays different.
Honestly the nmultiplayer modes just make me want to play the gamecube multiplayer.
Also some characters are straight up bad, which would be interesting if the game forced you to play them more, but it only happens once per character if that.
After Wario Ware Gold the story mode in this game is super disappointing, the voice acting and cutscenes in Gold were so good and thats just not in this game.
The most effort VA wise is in Penny's song, which is very good.
I miss smooth moves.
