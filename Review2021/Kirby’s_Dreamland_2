One of the two Kirby games I've actuaally barely seen anything for.
I was having a pretty good time with the 100% route until world 3, which was where they made getting the rainbow drops harder.
Don;t forget after beating the boss, you can come back for a minigame and that adds to percentage cause I didn't know that.
Final boss was actually hard because you get no animal friends and you have to go through three stages with stiff ccontrols.
Overall, pretty decent. Big imporvement over Dreamland 1.
Coo wiith umbrella ability completely broken, and if your animal counts as an additional health bar.
