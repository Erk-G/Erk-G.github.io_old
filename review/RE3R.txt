                While I think RE2R is a good replacement for the original for me, I don’t think the same about RE3R. 
                It’s pretty short, nemesis isn’t much of a threat past the first encounter, and hearing there were big parts cut out all make this game makes me kinda down on the game. 
                As a game it’s good, but as a remake it's disappointing.
