Never actually beat this game, got to the last area but never went into the last area.
My 100% experience was not great.
Boy is it hard to find out what you missed, and traversing Zebes is a pain because there are so many one way entrances/exits.
I am so not used to a floaty Metroid jump.
The very end of Norfair is so mean. The hidden wall to leave Norfair after Ridley doesn't go away when you point your x-ray.
You just have to know to walk through it. Fucked up.
The water area was the worst to traverse through because to 100% it you had to loop around it a few times.
I would have liked it more though if I didn't do 100%, so I could see myself playing this again.
