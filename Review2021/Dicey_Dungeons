I've been tackling away at this game for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
First Week: Wow this game is really fun and cool and I can't wait to play more of it.
</p>
<p>
Following Weeks: Kinda sucks how you only have like two build per dice.
God I hate playing Thief.
None of his builds felt fun.
God I hate playing Inventor.
You are at the mercy of having a good invention, because her regular attacks are awful unless you have upgraded boomerangs.
God I hate playing Witch.
But I did learn to appreciate some oppressive builds Witch can do with ice. Pro tips.
1. Keep cauldron, it's actually good.
2. Grab a spell that increases dice per game.
3. Grab spells that take two dice, its a good dice sink (blizzard is super good).
Why is most of the episodes as Jester, not playing how Jester plays?
Really, a love hate relationship with this game.
