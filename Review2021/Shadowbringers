Man this expansion story is so good it pretty much blows every other FF game’s story out of the water and is up there as one of the best stories in an rpg. It’s just too bad its locked behind like 140 hours of mmo before it, even more so because a lot of the side content from before Shadowbringers is attached to it in some way.

Music is so fantastic it can make me cry when listening to it. Thinking about certain points in the story can give me chills or make me cry. This is an expansion that actually made me care about all of the Scions and that is an amazing feat. (Except Y’shtola she is pretty much the same character coming out of shb, which to me makes her the worst Scion now.) This expansion is so good it could have ended FFXIV as a whole. The only reason I hesitate to call this my favorite story is because I’m pretty sure part of the reason I am still thinking about it is I still play this game.

Fuck, that last dungeon leading into the trial is so amazing and seeing all of the warriors from across the rift join for the trial is the best thing this game has ever done. Everything about Seto gave me a crisis about how I treat my own pet for days and whether or not I feel like I let him know how much I care about him. Seto’s situation is just so heartbreaking and the game switches it out on you at the end of 5.3 by having him and Ardbert have one last conversation giving Seto closure and a reason to live on. Damn, Graha is such a good dude and the end of 5.3 with all of the Scions and him joining is so good. I really like my interpretation of the WoL trial in that the Ascian you see help you is actually Azem and Hades only does his hand wave because he respected Azem so much. Thancreds final talk with Ryne about how he is proud of her and wishes for her to have all the happiness in the world brings me to tears. Tomorrow and tomorrow is such a good song.

I could go on and on.
