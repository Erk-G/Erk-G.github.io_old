Never played Psychonauts 1, only because I watched a full playthrough of it and honestly thought parts of the game looked too annoying to play.
(I did start playing it after Psychonauts 2 though, controls don't feel nearly as good.)
Started playing this cause it's on gamepass and heard it was an amazing 3D platformer and damn, it is.
Controls are tight for platforming, combat is weird, and the writing is very good.
Man it feels like this game was in development for over a decade.
I never thought it would come out good, much less amazing.
I regret not getting the physical editions of 2 and 1. This game is that good.

Man if I missed out on extra character interactions that I didn't know about that would be lame.
I say this because it feels like most of Raz's fellow interns don't talk that much and I don't really know half of them at all.
I like clarvoiance because it makes it very clear that every important adult in the pyschonauts sees a little bit of themselves in Raz, and that's just cute as hell.
I really expected Otto to be a bad guy in some way. It was just something about how most of the psycho 6 minds had nothing good to say about Otto.
I like how this game tied back into Psychonauts 1.
I like how the ending has Raz and the gang promoted to junior psychonaut and he's like "Nice!"
I like how there's a post game where you can talk to everyone about how they feel now.
Really the only things I think it weird is I don't know how I feel with Maligula still being alive, and more importantly how did Nick coerce Loboto Psychologically if her didn't have any psychic abilities?
This just goes back into the whole, pretty sure Otto was going to be a bad guy.
Anyways, game is great and I really enjoyed Raz's interactions with everyone.
