From MMO to game where you play an MMO.
Really slow start, it does not fell like the game starts until like your second element.
Everything about it feels like a lot of thought and care was put into it.
Except for <span class="spoiler"> Evotars. Feels like characters really under react to having digital clones of people. It is a more complicated subject than the game is willing to discuss.</span>
Music is great, gameplay is fun, characters well written and I always enjoy their interactions.
Can't wait for the dlc.
