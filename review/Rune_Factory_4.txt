                I don’t think I like this game. 
                I expected it to be like a more combat oriented Stardew Valley, but it was more like a simple dungeon crawler where one of the extra mechanics is farming. 
                Story isn’t great, the characters are okay I guess. 
                The amount of grinding I would need to do to stand a chance at the third arc pisses me off (like over 10 hours minimum), so I didn’t make it through the first dungeon of that. 
                I looked up the story for it and I’m alright with not finishing the third arc. 
                Too much content, not enough substance I guess.
