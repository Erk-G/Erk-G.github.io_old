Man they should really stop making Trails games 80 hours.
I really don't think they have made good use of that time ever since the first CS game.
This game had way less "PLEASE REAN ASK QUESTIONS" moments than the last game did, and they all came from the end so thats good.
I actually really liked the overall structure I just wish the first two acts were sliced in half or more.
The highlight of this game is the night before the final dungeon where every character in the series interacts with eaach other.
No joke spent like 3 and a half hours talking to everyone even original class 7 who I don't care about.
My biggest complaint, aside from length, is 
Really enjoyed the whole game overall.
