I really like FTL and was really digging Into the Breach for a good 10 or so hours there.
Then at some point I realized that the enemies always have a perfect strategy to them based on your equipment.
Meaning that if you have more equipment it makes the game harder.
The only time this isn't true is if you have a set up that is pretty broken, which is not what this game is about.
