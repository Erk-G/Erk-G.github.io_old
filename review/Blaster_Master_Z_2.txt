                Itâ€™s like a better Zero 1, and I like Zero 1. A good platforming game combined with top down shooter (sorta). 
                I hope the next game lets you play as the other characters you meet.
		SPOILERS <span class="spoiler">In the true ending you pilot the Andreia which was pretty fun.</span>
