I don't remember why I played through dark souls 3 again, but I did.
Went through the dlc for the first time. Dang, ice dlc final boss was the worst, there should be a checkpoint after the second phase.
Ringed City was way cooler.
Pretty cool game. It would've been cheaper for me to buy the complete edition on pc rather than buy the dlc for ps4 rip me.
