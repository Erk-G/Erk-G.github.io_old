Man this game gives players so much to work with, but none of the returning monsters adapted.
I can imagine a new player having the typical monster hunting eperience.
As a veteran, this game was way easier, but it makes sense why.
I just hope that unlike world, Capcom increases difficulty in a fun way.
Game is pretty fun.
