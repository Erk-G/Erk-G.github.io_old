                This is another one of those games where I got to the end (of both singleplayer and multiplayer), but didn’t beat. 
                Now that I have, all I can say is that I’ll miss old Monster Hunter when me and my friends finally accomplish our goal of being a trio of Fatalis armor buddies. 
                It's tough for me to recommend this game because, unless you have friends willing to play this, it’ll be tough finding people to help you rank up from low rank to G in multiplayer without it feeling too easy. 
                I guess you could just play the singleplayer stuff, and there is a lot of it, but my favorite MH moments from 3U and 4U are from playing online with randos. 
                I guess if you don’t have a PS4 or XBONE then maybe, but if you do then get Monster Hunter World because at least that game teaches you better and the online is more populated.
