Kind of a let down.
You aren't getting anything special for playing this game post automata.
Automata does everything this game does but better in every single way.
Seriously, the game is pretty boring and to get to the new content you need to play through the same game 4 times.
I am amazed at how little lore there is in this game.
A wiki dive can teach you more about the original Nier than playing the game because most of the lore exists outside of the game.
Just skip this game, and maybe watch the new coontent added to it if you wiki dived.
Music is very good though.
