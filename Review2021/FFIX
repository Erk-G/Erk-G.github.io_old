I'm not going to bother with all of the spoiler tags. After this paragraph it'll all be spoilers.
I wanted to play every FF game I missed, so 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13. 2 and 11 are not in consideration for obvious reasons.
8 and 13 are pains to play (but 13 did just come on gamepass). Not interested in 4 and 8. 
7 I feel like I've heard everything about, so it's obvious my first pick is 9.
This is a really special game, only hempered by development seemingly running out of time in act 3.
If you like Final Fantasy, play this game.
If you want to try RPGs you should also play this game.
