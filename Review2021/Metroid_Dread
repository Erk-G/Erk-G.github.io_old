Never expected a "Metroid 5" to ever be made, but here we are.
It's great. A little railroady at times, pushing you to go a certain way, and I do think there are too many tutorial cutscenes, but still great.
<span class="spoiler"> Now people calling Samus "Metroid" isn't untrue. The Metroid suit is pretty cool. I was in the middle of this game thinking 'They should design a new suit upgrade like in Prime' and while this was nnot what I had in mind it was still cool.</span>
Cool lore too.
