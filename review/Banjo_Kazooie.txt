                I played Tooie, never played much of Kazooie so here I am. When I was a kid I was pretty scared of everything, and man did Banjo Kazooie hit that fear in me. 
                Getting a game over+cutscene when you save and quit,the ambient laughter in the overworld, mummies in Gobi’s Desert, the shark in Treasure Trove Cove, Mad Monster Mansion, 
                specifically the VHS commercial cause I never got to Mad Monster Mansion. 
                I didn’t realize how much the fear affected me until I started playing and it made me really anxious, and it took awhile for that to go away.

                This is a pretty good collectathon and the problem I have with it that made me like Tooie better is fixed in the XBox version. 
                In the XBox version you no longer lose your notes when you die, 
                which is good because Rusty Bucket Bay has bottomless pits and Click Clock Wood is a giant stage where you constantly have to climb a tree which is just asking for death.
