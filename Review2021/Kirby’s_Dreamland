Technically I've played this 100% multiple times, but I guess I never did it aability-less so here I am.
Also, I don't think I've beaten Nightmare in Dreamland 100% but I am good, this is the only time I'm doing original/remake because its like a 30 minute game.
Yep this is an old kirby game. Can only go up from here. Since there is no percentage, I'm not going to do Extra mode because I don't feel like it.
Totally not worth 5 buck btw, this game should be cheaper on the eshop.
