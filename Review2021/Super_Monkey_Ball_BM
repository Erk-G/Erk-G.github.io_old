Techincally beating this game is just doing story mode, which is just a remmake of SMB2 story mode.
Good time. Man this game gets hard around the boiling pot world.
Excited to play through the monkey ball 1 content.
It also has every party game from monkey ball 1 and 2, so pool is back.
Monkey target would be the thing I'm excited for but apparntly it's not good, which is surprising beccause this game feels really good to play.
