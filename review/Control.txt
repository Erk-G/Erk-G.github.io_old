                It’s weird writing these things because I listen to podcasts and usually I agree with their opinions on games, so it feels like I’m just retreading old ground despite the fact that not everyone listens to it. 
                Anyway, the writing, which is reminiscent of the “Secure Control and Protect Foundation” articles, 
                is super interesting with the only difference being consistency in quality and I want to read pretty much every collectible. 
                The live action stuff is also really good and sometimes off putting like “Threshold Kids.” The gameplay is pretty fun cause the different powers you get and how satisfying they feel. 
                My only complaints are the ending  not resolving a whole lot, and how frequently enemies spawn which kills my desire for exploration since most of the time you need to fight them.
