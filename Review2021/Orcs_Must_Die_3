Really fun co op game. Some wonky difficulty curves and balance things. 
To be fair though my game plan is very stubborn so I barely deviated from the funnelinng barrier plan, but I don't know what to replace that with when it fails.
Feels momre shoot than the last game where I'm pretty sure by the end of every map the traps were self sufficient, which I thought was the point.
There's like a good five levels in the main campaign where there is too many spawn points very far apart to make a self sufficient trap set up.
I didn't beat the game on normal because the final level had a giant spawner on the last wave on both sides of the main gates that slapped us out of nowhere and we lost.
Second attampt the game crashed right before the last wave.
The added campaign you absolutley don't have enough money to make the traps do the work for you except for the one level where I decided to just ignore the war mechanics giving us enough money to put a ton of traps down.
Fun game, but it's pretty clear the "Make a set up that kills everything without you" mentality I had coming in was not the design philosophy.
(Seriously though why wasn't there a war version of tar traps and barricades?)
