Disco Elysiun is a hard game for me to write about because it walks it's own tightrope masterfully.
The world is depressing and unforgiving yet the game itself leaves the player hopeful.
It's like a combination of humoor and like a human element that I don't know how to describe.
This game is also just super well written, engaging and dense.
(Unfinished, I have to replay it again before I finish this.)
