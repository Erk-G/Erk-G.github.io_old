Man it feels like everything I said about Cristales is the opposite for Crosscode.
Probably because Crosscode has just had a ton of time put into it, but with this dlc pretty much everything Crosscode needed it has.
Sure there are some miinor nit-picks, that story issue from my last review still feels too intense to be taked about in game and the beach level is pretty weird overall.
Cool final boss, cool additions, really good music, characters still written really well. Great time.
