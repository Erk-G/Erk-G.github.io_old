                ZX Advent is slightly better than ZX is, in that its open world isn’t a hindrance to playing the game except for one part where I didn’t know where to go. 
                It’s also a little easier except for the last few rooms of platforming, which were a gigantic spike in difficulty. 
                Literally there were spikes and instant death areas everywhere. 
                They fixed some of my issues with the open world by having a lot of teleportation checkpoint things that you can teleport to from any save room.
                 While I wouldn’t play ZX again, maybe I would play Advent again. 
                They didn’t remove the voice clips when jumping though so that’s still annoying.
