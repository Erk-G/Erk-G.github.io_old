                I don’t like this game, but the music is pretty good. 
                The time mechanics are pointless, and hard to utilize to get a good future. 
                The peel out is pretty dumb compared to the spin dash which hurts enemies instead of enemies hurting you. 
                Stages don’t really stand out (I like the name Stardust Speedway, but the level doesn’t really look that different from any other one). 
                But Sonic Boom though.
