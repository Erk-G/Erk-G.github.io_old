                This game is really long, but it's not like its padded cause the levels are all unique but man this game is long. 
                Also, this game gets a demerit on its story for having an avatar character because every game I played that has one, the story is usually not that great. 
                Especially when they don’t talk like this one. 
                Hard to believe two people are best friends when they don’t interact with each other. 
                Also this game goes through time insanely fast unlike the first game. 
                You go from the beginning of Nobunaga’s conquest to his death in like two regions.

                The reason why I complained about length was because I just wanted to beat this game fast before Xenoblade. 
                To speed up my playthrough I used the cheesiest builds in the game. 
                I started with ninjutsu, which made the game pretty easy. 
                The snake boss was still hard because the missions to unlock the beginner spells for ninjutsu and onmyouji are after it. 
                The game is pretty unfun with ninjutsu’s main weapon, and when you run into a human that can block your kunai it sucks. 
                I switched to onmyouji and man the game is so much more fun with this build.
