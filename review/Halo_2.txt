                I wanted to play this game co-op on legendary like I did for Halo 1. 
                “It was fucked up. Halo [2] on legendary changes a man.” 
                The first level took us almost 3 hours because legendary co-op auto turns on the iron skull, and elites annihilate you. 
                Then we changed the difficulty to heroic and put on the iron skull to even out the difficulty. 
                Wow the PC version online co-op has a lot of glitches. 
                The most painful is the last cutscene on the level where you kill the heretic as Arbiter where if you try to watch it, it kicks you to lobby so you have to skip the cutscene immediately. 
                Other than the glitches it was pretty fun.
