From the dregs of my memory I remember the concept for this gae being really cool. 2D DMC like with a theme around movies.
In execution it is brutal. You do not have a lot of lives. Game over means back to the beginning of the stage.
Some enemies are the worst to deal with (pretty sure thats this game).
The boss rush is pretty harsh and Leo is just a bad time.
The most optimal way to deal damage is kiind of boring.
If this gane had infinite lives I would have liked it more.
