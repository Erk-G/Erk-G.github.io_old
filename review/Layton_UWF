Since I review these either right away or like months later, I really don't know how I would rate this against other Laytons.
I will say the factt that this is the last Layton starring game in the timeline is disapointing considering where the story is now.
Was kinda hoping a game starring Luke but nope.
The older Luke design in this game looks better than the adult Luke who just looks like a background NPC.
