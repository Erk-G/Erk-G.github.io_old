Gameplay:
Game has huge difficulty spikes in the early game and in the optional stuff at the end.
It can be discouraging at the beginning if you are totally new to the genre and you'll need to grind.
I honestly don't think it's possible to mainine the story.
Cid is busted and Female units have access to the best accessories in the game.

Spoiler Story:
I have a pretty good grasp on the general story, save for all the names and the walls of background lore text that exist.
It wasn't until Ramza teams up with Agrias in the battle with the noose in the middle that I really started to get invested in the story.
That was the point I realied that this was written like a play would be.
Kinda sad that because characters who join your party are allowed to die, when guest characters join they just stop talking.
Delita really got the shit end of the stick, and I feel really bad about Ovelia.
I feel even worse for Ovelia because there is no mention of what happened to her in the FFXIV content.
