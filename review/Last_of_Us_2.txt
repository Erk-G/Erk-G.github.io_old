                Speaking as someone who liked the first game, but who pretty much stopped liking Joel after a certain point 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU1 <span class="spoiler">I was really surprised I was the only one who thought he was kind of a monster after the hospital. 
                I was more inclined to think that way because I left no one alive in that section of the game, but I doubt everyone was sneaking through the whole section.</span>), 
                I thought the reason people were mad was dumb 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU2 <span class="spoiler">Like seriously we had a whole affair/one night stand on screen with Abby and that one guy and no one used that against her from what I saw</span>). 
                I liked the game for the most part. I thought it was too long and there was one story thing that made me pretty upset (SPOILER <span class="spoiler">When Ellie goes to California because 1. 
                Even in the best case scenario which does happen, she still ruins her life with Dina and 2. I had to play more game)</span>, but thatâ€™s about it.
