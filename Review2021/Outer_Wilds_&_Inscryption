I'm combining these two because you can't really say a lot about them without ruining the experience.

If you want a cool experience involving card games play Inscryption.

<p>
If you want a cool experience involving space exploration, discoveries and putting together pieces of a puzzle play Outer Wilds.

Pro tip for outer wilds: "Dozing off" and "meditation" are not the same thing. For the DLC if you want to have a chill time just turn the "spooks" in settings to zero.
The sections those effect should barely last anytime.
