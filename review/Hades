From one Rogue-like to another.
Hades is very good. 
Voice acting to music to game feel.
I only started to get sick of playing going for the secret true ending because I could not for the life of me get specific conversations to proc for the olympic gods.
It is really weird how complete this game is because normally with this genre of game there would be dlc to expect, but I don't see that happening.
