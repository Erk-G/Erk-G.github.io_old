Sequel to the game that made me really like CRPG’s, but this time I played with two other people instead of just one. 
That alone gives this game a lot of replayability since there is no way you are going to be able to get everything from the story when you have 3 people doing other stuff. 
It was great though, it’s nice having your turn at combat then seeing what your friend does and then they or you do something stupid and now everyone is on fire. 
I’m weirdly addicted to having 1+ hour long boss fights where the deck is stacked against you, or maybe we’re just bad, or uncoordinated, or both.
