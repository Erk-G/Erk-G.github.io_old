<span class="spoiler"> Felt like Ala Mhigo just got dumped on in terms of writing and the writers really only wanted to write the Doma stuff.
They gave Tsuzu a satisfying arc but not Fordola like what? 
I still won't get over the fact they make you do the sneaking into Ala Mhigo solely to introduce the salt mines as an economic resource.
