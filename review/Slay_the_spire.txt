                One of three roguelikes that I played and still enjoy, and the reason that it is on here is because the 4th act wasn’t out when I was playing it all the time. 
                So I did and beat the heart with ¾ characters (I can’t think of a deck for Ironclad that’ll beat the heart other than a barricade deck). 
                Roguelike deck builders are really good, and people should make more of them.
