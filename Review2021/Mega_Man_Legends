Wow a Megaman game with an actual good story?! Damn, unexpected.
Too bad the controls for Legends 1 is trash due to the PS1 not have analogue sticks,
L and R to move camera and d-pad to move around a 3d space. Nice.
I really like how going through the dig areas the atmosphere turns into a horror game.
Quiet, hear sounds of reaver bots moving around, doors make a loud noise.
Final boss is actually hard.
Every character is likable, all the cutscenes are fun to watch. The voice acting is nice.
Just wish the game had good controls and subtitles.
