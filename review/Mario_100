Never did this before. 
64 controls are surprisingly good but man the camera fights you.
Tick Tock Clock is a great level ruined by the constrained indoor camera.
Meanwhile Rainbow Ride does nothing cool, but it has the most free camera.
Will probably never do 100% again because there are some stars worth skipping.
