Finally got this game physically and to make a long story short, I wish I bought the collectors edition.
</p>

This game was insanely praised as like the next Paper Mario, and then it came out on switch and disapointed a lot of people.
The complaints mostly boiled down to two things. The smaller thing was "This isn't Mario", and because it wasn't it needed to be better.
The bigger thing was Bug Fables is an indie game. 
Game feel and the tons of small touches Paper Mario does were the biggest complaints, and I'm pretty sure Bug Fables does not have nearly the same resources the Paper Mario games did to perfect game feel.
As for the small touches maybe I could attribute that to man power and time, but I totally understand the complaint of it's use of the paper style.
</p>
<p>
Bug Fables doesn't need to be in a paper style, it doesn't utillize it in any special way nor do the characters acknowledge and play to it.
The game still looks nice in the style, but nothing woud change if it was just 2D sprites like Cristales was.

As for game feel, it is hard for me to see the complaints. 
I'd have to go back to Paper Mario 1 to make sure, but this game feels equivelant to that game.
I am a little biased in this aspect since I have played a couple of indie rpgs with either non-existent or garbage game feel when it comes to real time button commands.
None of the hits in this game feel chunky, but again I don't really remember any hits in PM1 being chunky either so I will revisit that at some point.

Another aspect that calls for me needing to revisit PM1 is the story.
In general it was kind of generic, but propped up by the fact it was Mario and enemies from Mario games with unique designs.
Unfortunatly like half of the party members barely look different from their enemy counterparts, Goombario has a hat, Bombette is pink, Kooper is blue an has a scarf, Lakitu guy has sunglasses.
The boo partner gets a point out of genericness because she is the rich daughter trope which is fun and fits into her character's attacks.
Meanwhile almost half of Thousand Year Door's partners aren't even Mario enemies
