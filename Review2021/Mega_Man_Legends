Wow a Megaman game with an actual good story?! Damn, unexpected.
Too bad the controls for Legends 1 is trash due to the PS1 not have analogue sticks,
L and R to move camera and d-pad to move around a 3d space. Nice.
Final boss is actually hard.
Every character is likable, all the cutscenes are fun to watch. The voice acting is nice.
Just wish the game had good controls and subtitles.
