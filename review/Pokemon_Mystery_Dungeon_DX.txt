                If you played PMD then this is PMD with some QOL changes. 
                Got all of the portraits except for Grand Master Rank which I don’t have patience for. 
                To people who have never played this game, try the demo and that is the whole game except at some point you just become OP if you look up how. 
                If you like PMD and have never played rescue team, then pick this up. 
                I don’t have much else to say other than the game series gets terrible review scores that I don’t think it deserves. 
                Very funny looking back at old reviews bashing on the gameplay, but most of those complaints are praises of rogue lights nowadays. 
                I normally like rogue lights, but something changed with my viewpoint of games and now I can’t stand not feeling like I made progress. 
                Dead Cells definitely triggered this feeling because once you’re good at Dead Cells, no matter what build you have you’ll make it to the castle and unless your build is complete garbage then you’ll make it to the final boss.
                Once you make it to the final boss though, if your build isn’t really good then you’re dead and you know going into the castle if you have a good enough build or not. 
                I beat the boss, MC makes a small comment, I look up if there is any story stuff, there wasn’t, uninstalled. 
                At least rescue team has a story to push me forward.
