Beat Speulnky hell run.
It was all fun and games until I actually started to do hell attempts.
This game is so brutal once you go for hell. You start to realize past stage 1 health starts to not matter and past stage 2 it is near irrelevant.
I wish health mattered more. Sure you never want just one hp because then everything kills you, but stage three onwards everything can one shot you.
Had a really good time.
