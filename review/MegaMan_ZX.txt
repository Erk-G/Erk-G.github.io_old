                The ideas in this game are cool, but man the execution wasn’t great. 
                Open world was more confusing to navigate than you’d think it would be, and on top of that you have to accept a mission first to “start a stage.” 
                At that point why not just make ZX basically a Zero game? The lives system feels so outdated in an open world setting. 
                I gave up doing 100% because I kept dying so much in the instant death lava area and if you game over you go back to the last save which is the very beginning of the “stage.”
                 Also I picked Vent over Aile because her jumping noise would have made me crazy. 
                Why would you make the character make grunt sounds whenever they jump in a platformer?
