                I played this with a friend on legendary, and it was a good time. 
                It was a little jank. 
                The levels are pretty maze-like and whenever the cool music swelled up it was always in a moment where we were lost or we lost a vehicle and had to walk a while so that was funny. 
                Being able to switch on the fly between old and new graphics was cool.
