Man they should really stop making Trails games 80 hours.
I really don't think they have made good use of that time ever since the first CS game.
This game had way less "PLEASE REAN ASK QUESTIONS" moments than the last game did, and they all came from the end so thats good.
I actually really liked the overall structure I just wish the first two acts were sliced in half or more.
The highlight of this game is the night before the final dungeon where every character in the series interacts with eaach other.
No joke spent like 3 and a half hours talking to everyone even original class 7 who I don't care about.

My biggest complaint, aside from length, is 
<span class="spoiler"> I can't believe they went with the route of Osborn was in control the whole time. Really makes the main ending suck ass because that is what Osborn was going to do anyway.
They really should have had a touching moment where the control wears off and he and Rean have some sort of moment where Osborn apoligizes because in the end he took on the curse to save Rean's life.
Another thing, really hhate how Claire stuck with Osborn to the end. You can make an excuse for Lector cause he has foresight or whatever, but Clare knows it's bad to side with Osborn. </span>
Really enjoyed the whole game overall.
