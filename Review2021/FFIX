I'm not going to bother with all of the spoiler tags. After this paragraph it'll all be spoilers.
I wanted to play every FF game I missed, so 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13. 2 and 11 are not in consideration for obvious reasons.
8 and 13 are pains to play (but 13 did just come on gamepass). Not interested in 4 and 8. 
7 I feel like I've heard everything about, so it's obvious my first pick is 9.
This is a really special game, only hempered by development seemingly running out of time in act 3.
If you like Final Fantasy, play this game.
If you want to try RPGs you should also play this game.

Damn I love the music in this game. This and FFX feel the most different to me compared to every other Final Fantasy.
I really like the theme playing when Steiner and Beatrix are defending Alexandria. A weird mix of epic and lighthearted.

While the least unique in terms of gameplay, the unique parts about it lend itself well to the story.
Ex. Steiner going into trance in the previously mentioned moment was really cool.
I really ike it when mechanics are tied into story even when it's pretty small.

Every character is written pretty well and watching them all talk to each other in ACTs was always nice.
Too bad as soon as act 3 starts, that all stops happening leaving Amarant with not much.
Honestly Freya got it worse. After visiting the sand village she barely talks, and she didn't get a resolution until the end.

I just realized I already wrote a review right when I beat this game so that will be right below this.
