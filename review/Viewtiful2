Wow this game fixed my problem by removing the lives system!
Oh god the mini boss rush is the worst thing in the franchise.
It actually ruins the game for me, the minibosses were not fun to fight against and you have to fight all of them in one life.
They should remake Viewtiful Joe 1 but remove the life system.
