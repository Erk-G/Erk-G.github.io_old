This game starts off running with it's soundtrack.
Controls are great, gamefeel is fantastic.
Short and sweet, a great MetroidVania (it actually is one this time).
The only problem I had was at the secret end stuff I had a choice of either getting good or grinding.
After failing at the very end I took the hour an a half of grinding.
