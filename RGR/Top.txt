<h1>Preamble</h1>
<p>
Before I start this list I will give an honorable #1 entry to the Trails/Kiseki series. It’s not the real #1 because it’s 7 games localized and 10 in total. All of it has kind of a connected story with each arc starting from “scratch” but eventually the previous characters show up and you should probably know what has happened before this arc takes place. Anyways it is kind of a dick move to be like “This is my number one” and dump 10 games on someone, and it’s not like the game is perfect anyway.
</p>
<p>
The first crack I remember is, I think, in Sky 3rd where in a door characters starting implying Agate and Tita should be in a relationship. Agate is like 22 and Tita is 12, so… yea. I don’t know why the writers keep this a running gag when they set up Agate (Spoiler for Sky 1) <span class="spoiler">to be a grieving older brother. Really thought it was going to go in the direction of a sibling thing.</span> At least I hope it’s a gag cause I can’t tell anymore. 
</p>
<p>
The second crack is in Zero/Azure when they started doing the multiple love interests thing. So far when this happens the pairings range from “I could see it” to “boring/I can’t see it” to “ew,” and in Zero/Azure you get all of these examples despite only having 4 choices.(Spoiler for Azure) <span class="spoiler">5 if you count Wazy, but I can’t really see it. I would be more upset if they picked the other 3 than Wazy though cause at least Wazy is interesting, has some chemistry with Lloyd and that third thing.</span> The 4 are Rixia, Elie, Noel and Tio. I think Rixia is a cute choice. I like how she and Lloyd can play off each other and their difference in jobs could make for more interesting scenarios. Her final bonding event with Lloyd pretty much sealed it for me because that is, I think, one of the three bonding events you actually learn something from and I thought it was nice. Elie is a pretty boring choice. She reminds me of Alisa in cold steel in that they are only in the running since they were the one the MC met first, and I don’t remember them doing anything. Noel is on the boring tier too except here she and Lloyd barely talk to each other alone. Tio is like 14, so...ew.
</p>
<p>
Cold Steel goes full harem with it and it’s pretty dumb. Almost everyone, except for maybe one or two, of the choices, ranges from “I can’t see it” to “ew” until Cold Steel 3 when the writers go hard on trying to make Alisa canon by making her the only bonding event the MC kisses in and in the fourth game where that almost happens with any girl you pick. By the way it’s 11 girls that are into MC in CS4 I think.

Anyways, from that side tangent you can tell I really like this game because I didn’t even talk about the main story of any of the games or the combat, and I could still write more about how dumb I think some of these pairings are. I could write way more like how in most rpgs I like when they tie the story and gameplay together like in Xenoblade with the power of the Monado. This game does it subtly. Like how arts(basically magic) is just produced from a machine and it’s reflected by EP which is just your machine's battery. Or how the sidequests are handles, which is like a typical guild in an RPG, but they make it clear how the Bracer Guild is a gauntlet for the people and their main goal is to just protect the population. Every member starts out at the lowest rank with just odd jobs that people want done and to rank up you have to think smart and be strong, so the people who rise up to the top are good people. I kinda expected every main character to a Bracer, but in the Zero/Azure arc the MC isn’t technically a Bracer.  He is instead in a newly created department of the police that acts like Bracers because the police have such a poor reputation among the population and the Bracers are just making it worse. So your group is in a unique situation where pretty much everyone doesn’t like you. Police think your department is unnecessary and you aren’t real police. People just think you’re useless police. Bracers shit on you because you are essentially just a rip off of them, but more importantly the party is made up of newbies so you don’t even help much with their workload. Watching the change of attitude over the course of the game was pretty great. Cold Steel has something similar except the game takes place at a military academy where there’s segregation between nobles and commoners. A higher up at the school saw how nice of an impact Bracers make in other countries, and since they are mysteriously not here the higher up decides to make a class basically instilling the ideology of Bracers. Starting off by making the class a mix of both nobles and commoners. There are some things that don’t really make sense like why is the rank system called “Detective rank” in Zero/Azure? When Cold Steel doesn’t take place in school, who is grading the MC? Who is this person who is grading you and why are they so stingy that they won’t give you the items when shit goes down?

<p>
In short, there is a lot of game in these games and I like all of it but most wouldn’t want to go through 30 hours to get to the point where they get obsessed.
