                I wanted to play some Paper Mario TTYD, and while I had the gamecube out I wondered if I ever actually beat Sunshine. 
                I knew I had gotten to Corona mountain multiple times, but I didn’t think I ever beat it. Turns out I didn’t, so I did. 
                Good Mario game I guess I’ll say even though I only played the last level.

                Mario collection came out, so I decided to 100% Sunshine. 
                Overall I had a good time, and there wasn’t a section I had a hard time with. 
                Going to 100% is pretty meaningless though because it only makes your experience worse. 
                Like, every main world in Sunshine has 30 blue coins and 2-5 of them are hidden well enough that finding them without a guide would take way too long. 
                Whether it is because you have to spray a certain section randomly to get it or the blue coin only shows up in one mission out of eight. 
                There’s also a handful of missions that just aren’t that fun. 
                The usual suspects, poison lily pad, pachinko, giant watermelon, casino secret (honestly playing Sirena Beach 100% was the least fun part even though I really like the idea of the area), etc. 
                There’s also some gameplay stuff in general I just dislike, the wind enemies make any Rico Harbor missions on the rafters just not fun, and navigating with the mud boat is terrible.

                I like the game a lot. 
                Any issue I had with how Mario plays in 64 is fixed in Sunshine. 
                They got rid of two key moves, the long jump and backflip, 
                but side jump is so easy to execute from a standstill it replaces the backflip and the long jump would be redundant with Mario’s new slide and especially with FLUDD.

                The biggest problem I have with this game is the requirement needed to beat it, which is to beat every Shadow Mario mission (mission 7 of each world). 
                It makes every other Shine Sprite pointless to get (technically there is a small point because the rocket nozzle is locked behind a certain amount of shines, 
                but you can get to the stage it is “required” for without it anyway with a good triple jump, so it is pointless), 
                especially considering the 100% reward is just a low res picture at the end of the credits. 
                So, just add a Shine Sprite requirement to get into Corona Mountain and BAM blue coins, Isle Delfino and mission 8 Shines have some value.
