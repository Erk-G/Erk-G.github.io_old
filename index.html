                Sequel to the game that made me really like CRPG’s, but this time I played with two other people instead of just one. 
                That alone gives this game a lot of replayability since there is no way you are going to be able to get everything from the story when you have 3 people doing other stuff. 
                It was great though, it’s nice having your turn at combat then seeing what your friend does and then they or you do something stupid and now everyone is on fire. 
                I’m weirdly addicted to having 1+ hour long boss fights where the deck is stacked against you, or maybe we’re just bad, or uncoordinated, or both.

                I played Tooie, never played much of Kazooie so here I am. When I was a kid I was pretty scared of everything, and man did Banjo Kazooie hit that fear in me. 
                Getting a game over+cutscene when you save and quit,the ambient laughter in the overworld, mummies in Gobi’s Desert, the shark in Treasure Trove Cove, Mad Monster Mansion, 
                specifically the VHS commercial cause I never got to Mad Monster Mansion. 
                I didn’t realize how much the fear affected me until I started playing and it made me really anxious, and it took awhile for that to go away.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a pretty good collectathon and the problem I have with it that made me like Tooie better is fixed in the XBox version. 
                In the XBox version you no longer lose your notes when you die, 
                which is good because Rusty Bucket Bay has bottomless pits and Click Clock Wood is a giant stage where you constantly have to climb a tree which is just asking for death.

                Man talk about a game with some pretty big flaws. 
                I like the idea of the combat, pseudo turn-based combat where each party member is assigned one button and they have a move set like in a fighting game, but there is no inbetween for difficulty. 
                At least I assume because it was pretty mindlessly easy the whole game. 
                There’s no point to trying to juggle enemies unless the enemy requires it, but that doesn’t happen often. 
                Mixing up combos doesn’t really work out and I’ll explain using Ajna (the main character) as an example. 
                Looking at Ajna’s two combos of holding up while attacking and not pushing anything while attacking, 
                holding up has her swing an axe and the rest is her shooting her bow and her normal combo is some punching that gets stronger as it goes on. 
                If you axe swing then go into her normal combo, it will start with her first punch which is the weakest so there really isn’t any reason to mix up your moves. 
                This makes some characters way worse than others, ex. Naga Rider who looks awesome but his normal combo starts with a ton of weak hits. 
                Your moves also aren’t contextual so if an enemy is flying you have to axe swing first before you pull out a bow. 
                I just now read you can blow up your arrows if you push down+attack after shooting arrows, which actually leads to my next point.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The game doesn’t explain everything about the combat with the biggest thing I don’t really understand being the heart level ups. 
                I get you get stronger, but I have no idea how much stronger and is it directly related to Ajna's power or is it just a person's motivation? 
                I wish there was like a training room in Ajna’s head so I can see what new characters can do (if there is one oops, but I didn’t see any). 
                Also, I can’t tell how effective Dhar’s charge move is compared to just doing an attack but I think that’s just me.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                
                The story is kinda all over the place I guess. 
                The set up is generic, which doesn’t automatically make a story bad as long as you can make it engaging. 
                I don’t know, everything up until the desert went by really fast and I never had enough time to get invested in anything happening. 
                There’s barely any world building in the story or in NPC talk. 
                It was honestly really jarring going back into a RPG with NPCs who have absolutely nothing interesting to say after playing through the Trails/Kiseki games. 
                All of the interesting stuff is behind the party member quests, 
                which is weird because it takes a long time before you can do any of them and by the time I got to that point I just wanted to beat the game for the most part. 
                There’s about 6 party members who Ajna meets by the beginning of the desert and I only remember 2 of them actually having important things to say in the main story as a whole. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                
                SPOILERS FOR THIS AND LAST OF US 2/UPDATE I thought the Dhar stuff at the end was done weirdly, but it wasn’t until after I played TLoU2 that I can see what could have happened. 
                Clearly it’s pretty impossible to forgive someone who killed someone you loved in front of your face, 
                but Dhar’s life afterwards gets turned upside down and he realizes how much of a piece of shit he’s been and knows he can never atone for any of it and I can tell Ajna sorta gets it. 
                She doesn’t need to forgive Dhar, but I kinda wish she had a conversation similar to Ellie and Joel about forgiveness or at least thought about it after Dhar died. 
                It doesn’t need to be something like she tries to forgive Dhar, but at least a conversation relating to how Dhar changed and how she feels now. 
                There's definitely some missed opportunity with Dhar considering how much dialogue he gets and how  he doesn’t really get brought up after he dies. 
                It felt like Ajna and Dhar were going to have a sibling relationship, but then the writer/s kept remembering Dhar killed her father and also a ton of people. 
                Basically, to me it kinda sucks how the most emotional moment in the main story is Ajna’s final conversation with Razmi even though their relationship didn’t really change through the whole story.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                
                The platforming is pretty good (which is good because you have to retread a dungeon like three times), and the voice acting was pretty great. 
                There wasn’t a single voice I thought was middling or bad. The art is really good. I wish there was more move variation per character rather than having more character. 
                Maybe having less characters would make it easier to inject the remaining ones into regular dialogue rather than them talking during their mini arc and then never again. 
                If this game gets a sequel or if Lab Zero develops something similar, I’d buy it. I think they could improve a lot of this.

                It’s like a better Zero 1, and I like Zero 1. A good platforming game combined with top down shooter (sorta). 
                I hope the next game lets you play as the other characters you meet since SPOILERS in the true ending you pilot the Andreia which was pretty fun.

                It’s weird writing these things because I listen to podcasts and usually I agree with their opinions on games, so it feels like I’m just retreading old ground despite the fact that not everyone listens to it. 
                Anyway, the writing, which is reminiscent of the “Secure Control and Protect Foundation” articles, 
                is super interesting with the only difference being consistency in quality and I want to read pretty much every collectible. 
                The live action stuff is also really good and sometimes off putting like “Threshold Kids.” The gameplay is pretty fun cause the different powers you get and how satisfying they feel. 
                My only complaints are the ending  not resolving a whole lot, and how frequently enemies spawn which kills my desire for exploration since most of the time you need to fight them.

                Fun game. Didn’t leave much an impression on me overall, but if I had to say one thing it’s that the bosses are basically like bigger enemies (Brought to you by a guy who 100% Spyro 1).

                One of three roguelikes that I played and still enjoy, and the reason that it is on here is because the 4th act wasn’t out when I was playing it all the time. 
                So I did and beat the heart with ¾ characters (I can’t think of a deck for Ironclad that’ll beat the heart other than a barricade deck). 
                Roguelike deck builders are really good, and people should make more of them.

                This is another one of those games where I got to the end (of both singleplayer and multiplayer), but didn’t beat. 
                Now that I have, all I can say is that I’ll miss old Monster Hunter when me and my friends finally accomplish our goal of being a trio of Fatalis armor buddies. 
                It's tough for me to recommend this game because, unless you have friends willing to play this, it’ll be tough finding people to help you rank up from low rank to G in multiplayer without it feeling too easy. 
                I guess you could just play the singleplayer stuff, and there is a lot of it, but my favorite MH moments from 3U and 4U are from playing online with randos. 
                I guess if you don’t have a PS4 or XBONE then maybe, but if you do then get Monster Hunter World because at least that game teaches you better and the online is more populated.

                Don’t let the first few missions fool you because this game is a pretty awesome platinum game. 
                The end of the prologue is how the whole game is played like. Gameplay is amazing and the only parts I didn’t like were the sneaking missions. 
                Make sure you seriously try out every Legion because I used all of them except the last one you get and they were all pretty useful. 
                The story is pretty lame. 
                Mostly because the ending is just bad and doesn’t explain anything. 
                If at any point in the game you wonder about something then chances are that question won’t get answered. 
                Still an amazing game though.

                Fixed all the issues Zero 1 had. Brutal difficulty? Mostly fixed. 
                The mid stage checkpoints really wanted me to snap my ds cartridge in half. 
                Luckily the Switch collection has a better checkpoint system if you turn it on. Grind? 
                The weapon XP is gone, but if you want to upgrade a lot of cyber elves then you need to grind. 
                So yea, it’s good.

                I like Zero 3. It tried to make the elf system more fair when it comes to rank by letting you upgrade them to equip them and not use them. 
                It kinda doesn’t work because if you need to do this you probably aren’t that good at the game. 
                It also introduced Omega who is pretty neat as a boss, but it also annoyed me with the story stuff about him. 
                SPOILERS I don’t understand the dilemma Zero has about Omega being his real body. 
                If the wording was phrased as “That is the real Zero.” that would have been cooler because then current Zero killing it would mean something along the lines of, Zero is more like a title or a concept than a name. 
                I feel like it would be cooler if it was worded like that.

                The ideas in this game are cool, but man the execution wasn’t great. 
                Open world was more confusing to navigate than you’d think it would be, and on top of that you have to accept a mission first to “start a stage.” 
                At that point why not just make ZX basically a Zero game? The lives system feels so outdated in an open world setting. 
                I gave up doing 100% because I kept dying so much in the instant death lava area and if you game over you go back to the last save which is the very beginning of the “stage.”
                 Also I picked Vent over Aile because her jumping noise would have made me crazy. 
                Why would you make the character make grunt sounds whenever they jump in a platformer?

                I will say I had some brutal failures in this game though. 
                I remember my one goal was to keep Artemy’s childhood friends alive and I couldn’t do that and that realization was depressing. 
                It’s also been awhile since I felt tense at the thought of going into combat especially when one quest forces it on you. 
                I like this game.

                I don’t like this game, but the music is pretty good. 
                The time mechanics are pointless, and hard to utilize to get a good future. 
                The peel out is pretty dumb compared to the spin dash which hurts enemies instead of enemies hurting you. 
                Stages don’t really stand out (I like the name Stardust Speedway, but the level doesn’t really look that different from any other one). 
                But Sonic Boom though.

                ZX Advent is slightly better than ZX is, in that its open world isn’t a hindrance to playing the game except for one part where I didn’t know where to go. 
                It’s also a little easier except for the last few rooms of platforming, which were a gigantic spike in difficulty. 
                Literally there were spikes and instant death areas everywhere. 
                They fixed some of my issues with the open world by having a lot of teleportation checkpoint things that you can teleport to from any save room.
                 While I wouldn’t play ZX again, maybe I would play Advent again. 
                They didn’t remove the voice clips when jumping though so that’s still annoying.

                It’s pretty short, nemesis isn’t much of a threat past the first encounter, and hearing there were big parts cut out all make this game makes me kinda down on the game.

                I had fun with Sonic 2 until Oil Ocean, which I didn’t like in Sonic Mania so that was not a surprise. 
                Then I got to Metropolis Zone and man this game gets brutal. 
                Why does the game get this hard? 
                Actually it might be wrong to call it hard and more fitting to call it unfair. 
                The zone acts are long, the platforming is dangerous, the screw elevators have enemies shooting projectiles at you, checkpoints are sparse and so are rings. 
                This zone also has 3 acts! Sky Chase zone is a short break before the game goes back to being brutal with there even being a leap of faith in Wing Fortress. 
                I’m guessing the thing that speeds sonic up isn’t supposed to just toss Sonic off the ledge and is supposed to keep him grounded and running in that part, but on the switch Sega Ages port it just kills you. 
                So this game is fun up until the point where it just hates you.

                This is the game that would have met the minimum expectations that I had for Secret of Mana. 
                There’s a ton of improvements for this game compared to the last one. 
                The useless charge attack system is gone and replaced with a special attack meter that when filled lets you do a special attack with different attacks unlocked later that require higher charge. 
                The percentage attack system is gone, so you can only attack when ready. 
                Chain casting is mostly gone and is unnecessary to fight bosses anyhow. 
                The characters are more unique and the story is better I guess. 
                There’s no music that grates the ears, and there is only one song in the game that is annoying at all. 
                The pixel art is amazing, and it’s probably the best looking game on the SNES. 
                There are save spots in dungeons that also act like inns.
                 Party members stuck on walls don’t stop you in your tracks, woo.
            </p>
            <h3>


                Story
            </h3>
            <p>
                With the positives out of the way, people who play Mana games should know there are always some big negatives. 
                The story is so tropey it’s unotible. 
                I only played with Duran as the lead but with other aspects of the story being pretty poor then I’m pretty certain that the other two storylines are just as tropey. 
                Duran’s dad was the best swordsman and best friends with the prince, and in the battle with the dragon lord he died. 
                Thus Duran aims to be the best swordsman especially after he brutally loses to a mage, and hey that mage has a dark knight ally. 
                I wonder who that is? Off he goes to get a class change, but then he gets chosen by the mana sword (which you never use cause Duran is the only character who uses swords and whoever you choose first is chosen) and he does stuff with the mana crystals to save the mana tree. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why I am pretty sure the story for the other two aren’t much better is mostly due to how little writing there is in the game. 
                There is a good half of the game where zero story happens and you just fight bosses for awhile. 
                I only remember special dialogue between party members happening twice in my party of Duran, Angela and Hawkeye. 
                The first when I recruited Hawkeye because he broke the part out of prison, and the other time being the credits with Angela and Duran. 
                This game is like 20+ hours.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Gameplay
            </h3>
            <p>
                Even though there are improvements, Secret of Mana’s combat was very flawed. 
                While party members stuck on walls don’t impede movement, they won’t be in combat if you fight on the same screen that they’re stuck.
                It is more efficient to use your level one specials then to wait for 2 or 3 in part because it’s a shorter wait time, but mostly because they pause combat to show you the animation. 
                Yes they didn’t fix the pausing of combat during animation heavy actions, so spells take forever to cast. 
                You cannot queue a command for a party member if they are either in the middle of physically attacking or have decided the next thing they want to do is physically attack. 
                Meaning there are going to be a lot of moments where you look like an idiot trying to menu to a different character before realizing you need to wait a few in combat seconds before you are allowed too. 
                The storage and pause menus take a very long time to load and scroll through. 
                Some enemies and bosses auto-counter special attacks or spells with their own, so if you walk into one of those encounters without turning off the AI’s ability to special attack then you are dead. 
                There are going to be moments where you know you are at the end of a dungeon and there are two exits on that screen. One being a save point and the other being the boss. 
                You will hate yourself and the game if you pick wrong and die.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can’t recommend this game, meaning there is absolutely no reason to pick up the Collection of Mana. However, the remake fixes every problem I have with gameplay as far as I’m aware so play that instead.

                This game is really long, but it's not like its padded cause the levels are all unique but man this game is long. 
                Also, this game gets a demerit on its story for having an avatar character because every game I played that has one, the story is usually not that great. 
                Especially when they don’t talk like this one. 
                Hard to believe two people are best friends when they don’t interact with each other. 
                Also this game goes through time insanely fast unlike the first game. 
                You go from the beginning of Nobunaga’s conquest to his death in like two regions.
            </p>

                The reason why I complained about length was because I just wanted to beat this game fast before Xenoblade. 
                To speed up my playthrough I used the cheesiest builds in the game. 
                I started with ninjutsu, which made the game pretty easy. 
                The snake boss was still hard because the missions to unlock the beginner spells for ninjutsu and onmyouji are after it. 
                The game is pretty unfun with ninjutsu’s main weapon, and when you run into a human that can block your kunai it sucks. 
                I switched to onmyouji and man the game is so much more fun with this build.

                I love Xenoblade 1, and this is more Xenoblade 1. It’s pretty short, and the end leaves a lot to be explained are my only complaints.

                I don’t think I like this game. 
                I expected it to be like a more combat oriented Stardew Valley, but it was more like a simple dungeon crawler where one of the extra mechanics is farming. 
                Story isn’t great, the characters are okay I guess. 
                The amount of grinding I would need to do to stand a chance at the third arc pisses me off (like over 10 hours minimum), so I didn’t make it through the first dungeon of that. 
                I looked up the story for it and I’m alright with not finishing the third arc. 
                Too much content, not enough substance I guess.

                I played this with a friend on legendary, and it was a good time. 
                It was a little jank. 
                The levels are pretty maze-like and whenever the cool music swelled up it was always in a moment where we were lost or we lost a vehicle and had to walk a while so that was funny. 
                Being able to switch on the fly between old and new graphics was cool.

                I wanted to play some Paper Mario TTYD, and while I had the gamecube out I wondered if I ever actually beat Sunshine. 
                I knew I had gotten to Corona mountain multiple times, but I didn’t think I ever beat it. Turns out I didn’t, so I did. 
                Good Mario game I guess I’ll say even though I only played the last level.
                <h3>
                Update
                </h3>
                <p>
                Mario collection came out, so I decided to 100% Sunshine. 
                Overall I had a good time, and there wasn’t a section I had a hard time with. 
                Going to 100% is pretty meaningless though because it only makes your experience worse. 
                Like, every main world in Sunshine has 30 blue coins and 2-5 of them are hidden well enough that finding them without a guide would take way too long. 
                Whether it is because you have to spray a certain section randomly to get it or the blue coin only shows up in one mission out of eight. 
                There’s also a handful of missions that just aren’t that fun. 
                The usual suspects, poison lily pad, pachinko, giant watermelon, casino secret (honestly playing Sirena Beach 100% was the least fun part even though I really like the idea of the area), etc. 
                There’s also some gameplay stuff in general I just dislike, the wind enemies make any Rico Harbor missions on the rafters just not fun, and navigating with the mud boat is terrible.
                </p>
                <p>
                I like the game a lot. 
                Any issue I had with how Mario plays in 64 is fixed in Sunshine. 
                They got rid of two key moves, the long jump and backflip, 
                but side jump is so easy to execute from a standstill it replaces the backflip and the long jump would be redundant with Mario’s new slide and especially with FLUDD.
                </p>
                <p>
                The biggest problem I have with this game is the requirement needed to beat it, which is to beat every Shadow Mario mission (mission 7 of each world). 
                It makes every other Shine Sprite pointless to get (technically there is a small point because the rocket nozzle is locked behind a certain amount of shines, 
                but you can get to the stage it is “required” for without it anyway with a good triple jump, so it is pointless), 
                especially considering the 100% reward is just a low res picture at the end of the credits. 
                So, just add a Shine Sprite requirement to get into Corona Mountain and BAM blue coins, Isle Delfino and mission 8 Shines have some value.

                Starting off, I immediately understood how this game was going to be RE4. 
                The first few missions are in a creepy castle, the music is like 4 notes that are supposed to invoke dread, fixed camera angles and there are kinda dumb puzzles. 
                This game brought a lot to the table. 
                Different weapons, different combos for the main two weapons, devil trigger, the style ranking. 
                List goes on, but there’s a few things that the game introduced that stuck around that I hated. 
                Fixed camera angles, and platforming being the main two I just wish didn’t exist (with the camera being the only thing I got used to in future games). 
                The game overall is only retroactively interesting to me considering it has 5 games ahead of it. 
                If the sequels never came out I probably wouldn’t have finished or even played this game. 
                I didn’t even like playing the game until I learned the grenade launcher fills devil trigger pretty quick. 
                The game is alright, but unless you really want to see where DMC came from then you don’t need to play it.

                Wow this game sucks. 
                I honestly can’t recall anything from the story since the game delivers plot so unequally. 
                There are cutscenes in this game that are like 20 seconds, it's hilarious. 
                Dante’s boring but I thought he was pretty boring in the first game so whatever. 
                As for gameplay, if you know anything about this game you would expect me to say you can just shoot your guns and win the game. 
                While that’s true, I’ll give the game credit in that it's not optimal. 
                You spam stinger at flinch less enemies/bosses to win the game. 
                Enemies are still pretty “shoot to win”, but sword is a little bit faster.
                Also, the sword doesn’t have any impact, and the other weapons are swords that have the same moveset. 
                You can ignore most enemy encounters, which is funny and also a little frustrating because I played this game while watching videos and sometimes I would mindlessly fight only to remember I can just leave. I got lost a lot in this game, so I had to look up a speedrun sometimes. The first phase of the final boss is the worst because I never collected any blue orbs and it combines every boss, which amounts to every boss shooting its high damage projectiles at you while having a ton of health.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s it really. I heard the one upside is this game has good music, but I don’t really like DMC music so there is no upside for me. Just a bad boring game. 
                It did introduce the gold orb system into DMC, so I guess DMC2 was worth it.

                This game has a reputation of being the best DMC game and it totally deserves it. 
                It honestly amazed me going from 2 to 3 just how good it is. 
                There are so many improvements that all I’m going to say is that this game is pretty equal to any other spectacle hack and slash I played in every way except graphically. 
                It’s just really good, and I plan on going back and maybe platinuming it once I finish the series.

                I wanted to play this game co-op on legendary like I did for Halo 1. 
                “It was fucked up. Halo [2] on legendary changes a man.” 
                The first level took us almost 3 hours because legendary co-op auto turns on the iron skull, and elites annihilate you. 
                Then we changed the difficulty to heroic and put on the iron skull to even out the difficulty. 
                Wow the PC version online co-op has a lot of glitches. 
                The most painful is the last cutscene on the level where you kill the heretic as Arbiter where if you try to watch it, it kicks you to lobby so you have to skip the cutscene immediately. 
                Other than the glitches it was pretty fun.

                A good game that has some issues. 
                I only played Nero/Dante cause I just wanted to play through the whole series first, so I might make some changes eventually when I play the other two campaigns. 
                So first Nero in general is just alright as a character. 
                Feels like a huge downgrade from Dante coming from DMC3. 
                Whenever Dante is in a cutscene, you know it’ll be a good time. 
                Otherwise the rest of the game has a similar tone to most DMC1 cutscenes where it's pretty serious. 
                Gameplay Nero is pretty fun with the new grapple and grab moves. 
                My only complaint is that Nero just has one weapon, which as someone who mostly uses Rebellion in DMC3 I’m fine with but going from like 6 weapons to only 1 for most of the game is so weird. 
                The game starts to show its flaws as Dante. 
                If you haven’t played DMC3 you are immediately thrown into the style system with enemies that are not lenient enough to practice with. 
                Overall though, you start to notice enemies are built for Nero’s buster. 
                A good example being the fish which I still don’t know how to fight those as Dante. 
                You also learn bosses are a cinch as Dante because of pandora and his styles, which hurts cause there is a boss rush at the end as Nero (the third time you fight these guys this playthrough) so you have to fight them the harder way. 
                It feels like the time you play as Dante is just a separate character campaign in the middle of Nero’s campaign, and if you take away Dante’s retread then there’s only like 13 missions in the game. 
                Other small notes. 
                Pandora is the only new weapon I like cause it's really cool and OP. 
                I don’t like how they give Dante a new style in his last mission where 1. 
                It is useless and 2. 
                There is no tutorial in game or the menus that tell you what you can do with it and 3. 
                The mission is a boss fight. 
                Dantes new style switching is a great addition. 
                I like the game, but it’s pretty flawed.

                As it turns out, I was right when suspecting other people’s rankings of DMC games. 
                Obviously this game is better than DMC2. 
                DmC’s story isn’t going to impress people, more like roll their eyes but man is DMC2s story way worse because it’s just boring. 
                Gameplay is not even a question. 
                I couldn’t even imagine how garbage DmC had to be to be worse, and the circumstances for people to release a shittier game than DMC2. 
                So of course it's better. 
                I also think it’s better than DMC1 because it is a modern game that wasn’t the first in its kind. 
                Like the “Seinfeld isn’t funny” trope, this game is better because the genre had evolved to be funner so it isn’t that hard to believe a game released in 2013 is better than the one that both started it and released in 2001. 
                A newer game can be worse than a much older game, but usually, especially with sequels/reboots, that isn’t expected. 
                On the whole this is on par with DMC4 because both games are fun but have a decent amount of issues from putting one over the other.


                Things I don’t like about DmC
                DmC is poorly balanced

                I heard this is pretty easy even on Nephilim, which is the hardest difficulty from the start. 
                To solve this in definitive they added a hardcore mode to rebalance it, but they rebalance it in more of the mindset that you have all the weapons and a lot of skills. 
                Meaning the first mission you’ll get a D rank in style, and even after that you probably won’t get above a C until much later. 
                The second angel weapon I felt was really necessary to fight some enemies and that is the last weapon you get about halfway through the game. 
                Devil trigger charges up too slow and burns too fast, so it’ll only be used for health regen or one combo on enemies that block your non-DT attacks.

                Cutscenes
                I’m not going to talk about the story because it’s not very good. 
                If DMC1 has one advantage that barely puts it over DmC and that is its cheesiness. 
                Cutscenes though ruin the replayability a little bit cause unlike most DMC games they are not limited to the beginning and end of a mission. 
                You can skip them but the worst of them are the walking cutscenes. 
                Cutscenes where you are just walking and there may or may not be dialogue happening, but you can’t skip them cause it is technically gameplay.
                

                Things from DmC I want to be in future DMC games

                How they do B combos
                In a DMC game, a B combo is when you pause in the middle then continue it making the character do different moves. 
                There’s not really any indicators, but I never saw that as a problem. 
                In DmC if you pause when you want to do a B combo then your weapon gets a flash, a “Shing” sound effect and your controller rumbles a little indicating when you can pull it off. 
                I like it. It feels nice.

                Better platforming
                Like any DMC fan I would actually prefer it if they just didn’t include platforming, but if they did just include the fixes this game gives like the airdash.

                Dante Grapple
                I like the grapple. Only problem I see is it would take away half of Nero’s uniqueness.

                Rank Scream
                I liked when the guy screams out the style rank name mid battle. You know you’re doing well when the guy screams “SAVAGE.” 
                I could see how people wouldn’t like it though because I liked...

                Stinger without Dante yelling
                Yeah I said it. It was annoying.

                L2 R2 for equipping weapons
                This is an idea I’m conflicted about cause it felt awkward holding down the button the whole time. 
                Maybe just pushing the button once to equip and pushing it again to re-equip Rebellion would work.
                 Like you push R2 to equip the Axe you could push it again to equip Rebellion or you could equip the scythe and push L2 again to equip Rebellion.
                

                Anyway, DmC is good but is pretty rough around the edges. Nothing in DMC 1-4 beats the TV fight or the gimmicky disco colosseum in terms of creative missions.

                I had 2 separate opinions on this game, one was my first two playthroughs and the other at the end of my playthroughs. 
                My first was ‘Jesus this game is way harder than the first and probably too much so.” 
                My second is “This was actually pretty fun, but feels way too long.” 
                If there is one thing I could add to this game that would bump it up to a ‘recommend for everyone’ rating, it would be adding an option for infinite lives but without the other stuff ‘casual mode’ adds (maybe keep the increased checkpoints though because the platforming before the mummy boss is draining). 
                I’m fine with the increased damage and the knockback, but I would like to not start over from the very beginning if I die too much. 
                This is all for the first time experience though, since like with most games if you play it enough you learn and deal with the challenges. 
                Except that bat boss that makes a return from CotM1, she goes so fast that I hate that fight even though you have infinite lives for it as long as you collect all the money bags from the 5-8 minute trek back to her fight. 
                This game has one extra playthrough than the first but the levels feel too samey and the final chapter wants you to do multiple runs of one level if you want to get all the upgrades. 
                Best characterization in a Bloodstained game though.

                If you played PMD then this is PMD with some QOL changes. 
                Got all of the portraits except for Grand Master Rank which I don’t have patience for. 
                To people who have never played this game, try the demo and that is the whole game except at some point you just become OP if you look up how. 
                If you like PMD and have never played rescue team, then pick this up. 
                I don’t have much else to say other than the game series gets terrible review scores that I don’t think it deserves. 
                Very funny looking back at old reviews bashing on the gameplay, but most of those complaints are praises of rogue lights nowadays. 
                I normally like rogue lights, but something changed with my viewpoint of games and now I can’t stand not feeling like I made progress. 
                Dead Cells definitely triggered this feeling because once you’re good at Dead Cells, no matter what build you have you’ll make it to the castle and unless your build is complete garbage then you’ll make it to the final boss.
                Once you make it to the final boss though, if your build isn’t really good then you’re dead and you know going into the castle if you have a good enough build or not. 
                I beat the boss, MC makes a small comment, I look up if there is any story stuff, there wasn’t, uninstalled. 
                At least rescue team has a story to push me forward.

                This game is another that got trashed by reviews, but to put it simply, this game is rad. Music is amazing, voice acting is funny, and the gameplay is funner than any other Double Dragon I ever played.

                Man it is really weird how not a whole lot sticks with me after I finish a Halo game. 
                The music was good, and I didn’t like the Scarab fights.

                Speaking as someone who liked the first game, but who pretty much stopped liking Joel after a certain point 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU1 I was really surprised I was the only one who thought he was kind of a monster after the hospital. 
                I was more inclined to think that way because I left no one alive in that section of the game, but I doubt everyone was sneaking through the whole section.), 
                I thought the reason people were mad was dumb 
                (SPOILERS FOR TLOU2 Like seriously we had a whole affair/one night stand on screen with Abby and that one guy and no one used that against her from what I saw). 
                I liked the game for the most part. I thought it was too long and there was one story thing that made me pretty upset (SPOILER When Ellie goes to California because 1. 
                Even in the best case scenario which does happen, she still ruins her life with Dina and 2. I had to play more game), but that’s about it.

                DMC5 is the best DMC in the series, and if a special edition releases and it gets as much content as DMC4SE then it won’t even be an argument. 
                Style switching on the fly, check, able to use all different weapons, check, all of the different weapons are fun to use, check, kept the dude screaming style names, check, zoom in when the fight is over, I mean I didn’t really want it but it’s there. Gave Nero some sweet abilities on his “style” button instead of the lame but strong grapple thing (SPOILER And they keep the ability to use his old arm with an actual devil trigger). A DMC game finally has a song I like in it, both versions of “Devil Trigger.” 
                I like the effort they put into the story because no other DMC game really cared at all. 
                There were only a few middling things in this game. 
               
                Why can’t I just switch between Nero’s arms? You can make it take awhile, but needing to break them is lame.
                
                V isn’t that cool to play as but you don’t play as him much.
                
                Dr. Faust feels like wasted potential at least for the playthrough you get it. 
                You need red orbs for upgrades and the hat either wastes them or has huge risks to using it, but it looks so cool.
                
                I hope if DMC5SE gets made has online bloody palace multiplayer since they added that into DMC3SE switch edition, and maybe add in the characters that were added in DMC4SE.
