WHOAAAA, BETTER CONTROLS AND THE WRITING IS STILL GOOD?! Spoil me more Capcom.
I can't put into words how much this game makes me sad that a Legends 3 existed and was axed before anyone could touch it.
No subtitles, but did I mention how much I like Legends music?

Both games story spoilers:
I like how Megaman actually has a name, Volnutt. Actually he has two names, Trigger. I think? I don't remember.
There is a surprising amounnt of lore in the Legends series.
Poor Roll basically does not have parents anymore. Kinda shitty that the dad won't even tell Roll about him even though they both know.
I wish Megaman actually talked to the bad guys in dungeons, he just stares angerly at them while they talk at him.
Every new character is a joy to watch. 
The Bonnes are the best thing this series adds to the Megaman franchise.
Please I just want more megaman legends.
