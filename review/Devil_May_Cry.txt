                Starting off, I immediately understood how this game was going to be RE4. 
                The first few missions are in a creepy castle, the music is like 4 notes that are supposed to invoke dread, fixed camera angles and there are kinda dumb puzzles. 
                This game brought a lot to the table. 
                Different weapons, different combos for the main two weapons, devil trigger, the style ranking. 
                List goes on, but there’s a few things that the game introduced that stuck around that I hated. 
                Fixed camera angles, and platforming being the main two I just wish didn’t exist (with the camera being the only thing I got used to in future games). 
                The game overall is only retroactively interesting to me considering it has 5 games ahead of it. 
                If the sequels never came out I probably wouldn’t have finished or even played this game. 
                I didn’t even like playing the game until I learned the grenade launcher fills devil trigger pretty quick. 
                The game is alright, but unless you really want to see where DMC came from then you don’t need to play it.
