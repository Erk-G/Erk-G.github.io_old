                This game has a reputation of being the best DMC game and it totally deserves it. 
                It honestly amazed me going from 2 to 3 just how good it is. 
                There are so many improvements that all I’m going to say is that this game is pretty equal to any other spectacle hack and slash I played in every way except graphically. 
                It’s just really good, and I plan on going back and maybe platinuming it once I finish the series.
