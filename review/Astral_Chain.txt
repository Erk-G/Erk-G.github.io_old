                Don’t let the first few missions fool you because this game is a pretty awesome platinum game. 
                The end of the prologue is how the whole game is played like. Gameplay is amazing and the only parts I didn’t like were the sneaking missions. 
                Make sure you seriously try out every Legion because I used all of them except the last one you get and they were all pretty useful. 
                The story is pretty lame. 
                Mostly because the ending is just bad and doesn’t explain anything. 
                If at any point in the game you wonder about something then chances are that question won’t get answered. 
                Still an amazing game though.
