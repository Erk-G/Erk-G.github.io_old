                Fixed all the issues Zero 1 had. Brutal difficulty? Mostly fixed. 
                The mid stage checkpoints really wanted me to snap my ds cartridge in half. 
                Luckily the Switch collection has a better checkpoint system if you turn it on. Grind? 
                The weapon XP is gone, but if you want to upgrade a lot of cyber elves then you need to grind. 
                So yea, itâ€™s good.
