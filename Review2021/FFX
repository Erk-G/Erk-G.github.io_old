Despite my intention of onlny playing FF games I missed, after playing through 9, I got really curious about 10.
I plaed it once before years ago but I really didn't remember a lot about it.
I wanted to see if it stood up to the game I just played so here I am.

Spoiler free part here.
It is very good. Characters talk to each other much more than I remember and you end up learning a lot about each party member.
10 really goes toe to toe with 9 especially since 10 doesn't feel rushed from the outset.
There are a lot of lore things that if you look too closely at it breaks down fast, but as long as a story does not focus too much on it I don't notice.
The only parts that are bad in story are the really cheesey parts, but they're fine.
Music is amazing. Except when you are doing those fucking puzzles.
Fuck doing some of those puzzles, kills the pacing.
Seriously getting the bonus item for one of them requires doing the whole puzzle again.
When choosing an rpg to play, this is a really good one.

I am so dumb, I did not realize Yuna was an airhead when I played this on the PS3.
Something sad about the PS4 version, I barely hear the battle voicelines. RIP Titus's "Live and let live!"
I usually hate the "Shitty dad cared about you" trope, but this game actually managed to do something different with it.
Turns out, Ject was the one telling his mom to take care of him. Wow, that's kind of fucked. Basically means Titus had no connections in Zanarkand.
I remember Ject had some sort of reason to be tought on Titus, but considering I don't actually remember the reason it was probably flimsy.
Watching Ject improve hiimself over his journey was probably pretty painful for Titus,
